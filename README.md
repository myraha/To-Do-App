# Todo app

**Link to project:** https://myraha.github.io/To-Do-App/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Users can add new list items, mark items completed, clear completed tasks or entire lists, and edit list items.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was one of my favorites as I was able to combine a lot of newer concepts in one app. Something I found difficult was finding a way to edit inline list items. I eventually found the contenteditable attribute, which is a quick fix for now.
